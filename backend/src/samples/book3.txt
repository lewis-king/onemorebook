"Once upon a time, in a cozy little house, there lived a teddy bear named Teddy. Teddy was loved dearly by his owner, a sweet little girl named Lily. One sunny afternoon, Lily decided it was time for Teddy to have a bath. Teddy was a bit nervous, but Lily assured him that it would be fun. She filled a tub with warm, bubbly water and gently placed Teddy inside. At first, Teddy was unsure about the water, but as Lily started scrubbing him with a soft sponge, he began to relax. The bubbles tickled his nose, and soon he was giggling and splashing around. After a good scrub, Lily wrapped Teddy in a fluffy towel and gave him a big hug. Teddy felt clean, fresh, and loved. From that day on, Teddy looked forward to bath time, knowing it was an adventure filled with bubbles and laughter."
